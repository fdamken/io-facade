NOTE: This is the header for everything where you can use <!-- ... --> to
    insert a block of free text. Please lookup HEADER,
    HEADER-CMN, HEADER-DASH, HEADER-HASH and HEADER-XML for
    other header types.
    
    Please notice that it is not required to add this header
    to files like pom.xml (project config files), but it _is_
    necessary to add this header to every file that gets
    packaged and deployed (i.e. web.xml).
