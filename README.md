IO Facade
=========

IO Facade is a simple facade for input/putput operations on files. It works as a facade between normal file-operation libraries, like the regular Java IO API (java.io) or some FTP libraries. With the IO Facade it is possible to operate on any of them without changing the code.
This can be used to run integration tests on multiple servers with multiple environments, for example.
